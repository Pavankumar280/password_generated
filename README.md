## Description

This Password Generator is a customizable tool built using React with a sleek Cyberpunk theme. The generator allows you to create secure passwords with a length of 8 characters by default, and you can increase the length as per your requirements. You also have the option to include numbers and special characters through checkboxes. With every page refresh, a new password is generated.

The design uses the Orbitron font, giving it a futuristic look, while the color scheme revolves around black, #e7ea45 (for vibrant highlights), and #11F3Fc (for input borders). The input backgrounds have a deep #00181a color to match the overall dark theme.

This project is very simple to set up and can be customized further as needed.
